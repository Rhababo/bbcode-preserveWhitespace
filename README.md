The goal of this repo and plugin is to provide users with the BBCode suite that they have been used when it comes to using our site before our migration to Discourse and make sure that old posts rebake correctly. Above in the chart is marked our status on each BBCode which will hopefully co-exist in tandom even with the markdown/htlm versions provided in the box experience by the Discourse Software.
